# visi0n
This software is proof of concept and in no way do I condone using it in nefarious ways. 
Misusing this software is illegal!
Visi0n is a tool that is meant to test against servers (that you own or have permission to attack) to see if they're vulnerable
to dns based dos attacks. User will need a list of dns servers in order to use the tool.
